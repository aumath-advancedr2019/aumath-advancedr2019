### Welcome to AuMath-AdvancedR 2019!

This is the front page of a course on advanced R programming, run in fall semester 2019 at the maths department of Aarhus university.
We were 17 students and one course organizer ([Ute Hahn](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/ute@math.au.dk)). During the course, student teams developed R packages on various topics. Using the `pkgdown` R package, they also created web pages introducing their packages - see the links below.

#### Packages for evolutionary genetics modelling
<!-- * [Abands](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/Abands/). This was only a demo repository and will be removed here later -->
* [PhaseTypeGenetics](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/PhaseTypeGenetics/) Phase type distributions, theory and simulation.
* [ticphasetype](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/ticphasetype/index.html) Core functions from phase-type theory that are useful in the analysis of biological data.
* [simDNA](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/simDNA/) Simulating DNA sequences according to different evolutionary models.

#### Computational statistics packages

* [Sampling](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/Sampling/) Permutation tests and bootstrap intervals.
* [Permutation1](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/Permutation1/) Permutation tests, with a focus on tests for linear models.
