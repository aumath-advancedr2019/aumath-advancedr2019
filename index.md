Welcome to AuMath-AdvancedR 2019!

This is the front page of a course on advanced R programming, run in fall semester 2019 at the maths department of Aarhus university.
We are 17 students and one course organizer ([Ute Hahn](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/ute@math.au.dk)). During the course, student teams developed R packages on various topics. 

Here are links to some of these packages:

* [Abands](https://aumath-advancedr2019.github.io/Abands/). This was only a demo repository and will be removed here later
* Something you are proud of
